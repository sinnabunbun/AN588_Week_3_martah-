Alright I'm starting with an attempt to use poissson distribution.

``` {r poisson}
x<- rpois(1, 15) #where 1 is the n value since its 15 is the  mean of the two hours and 15 is the mean or lambda
x
```
``` {r lessthan}
ppois(8, (rpois(1, 15)), lower=FALSE) #I can't tell if I should be running lambda as 15 for the mean or x where x is the rpois? or as i put here, lmbda being the function of rpois?
```
``` {r nocalls}
dpois(20, 15) #same problem but this time i set lambda as 15
```
