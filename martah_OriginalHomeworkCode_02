Alright I'm starting with an attempt to use poissson distribution.

``` {r poisson}
x<- rpois(1, 15) #where 1 is the n value since its 15 is the  mean of the two hours and 15 is the mean or lambda
x

#Talking to Zoe I realized this isn't necessary but It does help me visualize so I'll keep it in
```
Important thing I kept mixing up `dpois` and `ppois` which is bad >>:( ppois is a cumulative probability function while dpois is a probabilty density function which will give you the probabality of a given 
value 

``` {r morethan}
1-ppois(8, 15)
#find the inverse of the distribution of ppois where x=8 and lambda=15. Switched out ppois with dpois but ppois is the _cummulative probability_
```
Also can use `ppois(8, 15, lower.tail = F)` instead of getting the complement or inverse using `1 - ppois` 

``` {r nocalls}
dpois(0, 15) #this is using the same function as above, substituting x for 0 instead of 8 
```

``` {r 3calls}
dpois(3, 15) #again, substitute x for 3 to get three calls
```

``` {r 1-30}
calls<- 0:30
barplot(dpois(calls, 15), xlab = "Calls",
    ylab = "Frequency", col = "orange")
#plotting the data in a barplot
```
``` {r 104}
exampledist<- rpois(104, 15)
exampledist
#still unsure how `set.seed()` works and if it would be helpful here?
```

``` {r hist}
hist(exampledist, col = "purple", main = "Titi Calls Over 2 Years", xlab = "Calls",
    ylab = "Frequency", xlim = c(0, 30), breaks = 30)
```
I originally had `freq = F` which put my y-axis in .00 magnitude. Not sure entirely how this helps/hurts but I took it out and added breaks in the graph.

## Challenges

1. I'm very concerned with how low my probabilities are in the first section, part of the problem is I'm not sure of the magnitude of the values like should they be over 1, under 1, etc.?  
  _ZOE: Because its a probability, it should be under one?_  
  Me and Zoe worked this out!I forgot most frequencies are expressed as percentages so it makes sense for it to be under 1.  
  
2. With lambda, if I use `x` that is a variable variable if that makes sense. It vastly changes the results if I use x, 15 (the mean), or the function itself. I simply do not know what is the proper lambda is??  
  _ZOE:I also struggled with this.  I think 15 has more significance than just her hypothesis._  
  Yes, and we decided using 15 as the mean every time will give the averages as opposed to a specific variable from the distribution.  
  
3. This is a content question, I am not sure when I should be assigning functions to an element. The examples will usually use the function every time but I'm not sure.  

4. The syntax for `rpois` was really confusing a first and now I'm worried it seems to easy. I am operating on (number of vectors, mean) essentially.
  _ZOE:No over thinking!  You got this.  It is simple once we figured it out._  
  
5. In the final histogram I mention this but I want this plotted with a point for every weekend, not a barplot of overall means. I'm not sure a) how to do this and b) if I'm even suppose to be doing this  
_ZOE:I think we discussed/decided that this should be frequency of calls per hour._  
Yes, I was confused that we were plotting frequencies instead of points but this makes more sense now.
